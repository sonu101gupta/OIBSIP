#Project Description: 

Task 2- Personal Portfolio
The project hosted on GitHub is a portfolio website created by me. This portfolio serves as a showcase of My personal projects, highlighting their skills, experience, and accomplishments. The website is designed to provide visitors with an overview of my work and expertise in various domains.

Built using modern web development technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the portfolio website features a clean and visually appealing design. It offers a user-friendly experience, making it easy for visitors to navigate through different sections and explore the showcased projects.

The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate My proficiency in web development, design, and problem-solving. Each project displayed on the website includes a detailed description, highlighting the technologies used, the challenges overcome, and the outcomes achieved. Visitors can also find images and links to further explore each project's details.

Additionally, the portfolio website includes an 'About' page that provides comprehensive information about Sonu's educational background, work experience, and passion for technology. This page allows visitors to gain deeper insights into My skills and expertise.

The portfolio website is hosted on Netlify, a popular platform for deploying static websites. Netlify ensures the website's availability and provides a reliable hosting solution. By hosting the project on GitHub, I also leverages the benefits of version control, enabling easy collaboration, tracking of changes, and maintaining a clean codebase.
